# Contributed Repo Finder

Welcome to Contributed Repo Finder, a React application that allows you to fetch and explore the contributed repositories of a GitHub user. With this app, you can easily discover the repositories and their details with just a few clicks.

## Features

- Enter the GitHub username in the input field and click on "Fetch" to retrieve the contributed repositories.
- Each repository card displays the name(which is linked to that repo url), description, number of stars, and number of forks.
- Use the pagination buttons to navigate through the repositories. Click the "Previous(<)" button to go to the previous page, and the "Next(>)" button to move to the next page.
